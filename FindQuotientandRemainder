/*
Write a C++ Program to Find Quotient and Remainder of 2 numbers. Hereâ€™s simple C++ Program to Find Quotient and Remainder of 2 numbers in C++ Programming Language.

In this program, user is asked to enter two integers (divisor and dividend) and computes the quotient and remainder.
To compute quotient and remainder, both divisor and dividend should be integers.
