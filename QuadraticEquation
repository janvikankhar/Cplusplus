/*
Write a C++ Program to Find Roots of Quadratic Equation using if else.

Here’s simple C++ Program to Find Roots of Quadratic Equation using if else in C++ Programming Language.

A quadratic equation is in the form ax2 + bx + c. The roots of the quadratic equation are given by the following formula −

There are three cases −
b2 < 4*a*c - The roots are not real i.e. they are complex

b2 = 4*a*c - The roots are real and both roots are the same.

b2 > 4*a*c - The roots are real and both roots are different

The program to find the roots of a quadratic equation is given as follows.
