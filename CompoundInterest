/*
Write a C++ Program to Calculate Compound Interest. Hereâ€™s simple Program to Calculate Compound Interest in C++ Programming Language.

The formula for annual compound interest, including principal sum, is:

A = P (1 + r/n) (nt)A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

{ 
   float p,r,t,ci;
   cout<<"Enter amount : ";
   cin>>p;

   cout<<"Enter time period : ";
   cin>>t;
   ci = p*pow((1+r/100),t);
   cout<<"The Calculated Compound Interest is : "<<ci;
